# ðŸ’¬ PanNotifications

PanNotifications is a simple FiveM resource that sends notifications to players.

Only became a thing because I hate the default FiveM notifications.

## Usage

### Client

```lua
exports.PanNotifications:DisplayNotification({
    title = "Testing info message!",
    body = "Testing info message!",
    type = 'grey',
    icon = "fab fa-angellist"
})
```

### Server

```lua
TriggerClientEvent('panNotifications:notify', source, {
    title = "Testing info message!",
    body = "Testing info message!",
    type = 'grey',
    icon = "fab fa-angellist"
})
```
